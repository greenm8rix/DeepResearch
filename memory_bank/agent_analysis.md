# Analysis of `src/research_agent/agent.py`

## Role

*   Acts as the central **orchestrator** for the research workflow.
*   Manages the overall state of the research process.

## Initialization (`__init__`)

*   Accepts `db_path` and `citation_style`.
*   Initializes core state variables:
    *   `current_query` (str | None)
    *   `research_plan` (dict)
    *   `findings` (defaultdict[str, list])
    *   `sources` (dict)
    *   `processed_paper_ids` (defaultdict[str, set]) - Tracks papers evaluated *per subtopic* per run.
*   Initializes caches: `relevance_cache`, `findings_cache`.
*   Calls `init_db` (from `db_utils`) to set up the database schema.

## Workflow Orchestration (`run_full_workflow`)

*   Resets agent state via `self.__init__` at the beginning of each run.
*   Determines the citation style for the current run.
*   Calls functions from refactored modules in sequence:
    1.  `planning.generate_research_plan`
    2.  Loops through subtopics (using `tqdm`):
        *   `researching.research_subtopic`
        *   `synthesis.consolidate_findings`
    3.  `writing.write_all_sections`
    4.  `compilation.compile_final_report`
*   Uses basic `try...except` blocks around module calls for error handling.
*   Returns `{"report": final_report_string, "plan_id": plan_id}`.

## State Management

*   Holds the primary state (`findings`, `sources`, `processed_paper_ids`, caches).
*   Passes mutable state variables directly as arguments to sub-modules (`research_subtopic`, `consolidate_findings`), which modify them in place.

## Database Interaction

*   Database *saving* logic (plans, sources, findings) has been moved to the respective step modules.
*   Retains an `_execute_db` method but doesn't explicitly pass it to sub-modules in the current code. Sub-modules likely use imported `db_utils` functions directly.

## Configuration Usage

*   Uses `SQLITE_DB_FILE` from `config.py` as the default `db_path`.
*   Imports `PDF_ANALYSIS_ENABLED` but does not use it directly. This reinforces the need to check its usage in `researching.py` and confirms the previously identified configuration flaw is not addressed here.

## Overall Assessment

*   Successfully implements the orchestrator pattern, separating workflow control from step-specific logic.
*   Relies on passing mutable state, which is functional but requires careful understanding of side effects in sub-modules.
*   Error handling is basic.
