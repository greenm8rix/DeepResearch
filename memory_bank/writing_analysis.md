# Analysis of `src/research_agent/writing.py`

## Core Function: `write_all_sections(...)`

*   **Purpose:** Handles Step 4 of the workflow - generating the textual content for each section of the research document based on the plan and consolidated findings.
*   **State Interaction:** Primarily reads from `research_plan`, `subtopic_consolidations`, `findings`, and `sources`. Uses `db_path` to pass `execute_db` capability to `get_raw_findings_text`.

## Process Flow:

1.  **Compile Reference Material:**
    *   Iterates through all sections/subtopics in the plan.
    *   For each subtopic, combines:
        *   Consolidated data (themes, summary, etc.) from `subtopic_consolidations`.
        *   Raw findings with pre-formatted in-text citations obtained via `aggregation_utils.get_raw_findings_text` (passing `execute_db` via lambda).
    *   Aggregates this information into a single large `reference_material` string.
2.  **Write Sections Sequentially:**
    *   Iterates through each `section` defined in the `research_plan`.
    *   Initializes `previously_written_text` (empty at first).
    *   **Prompt Construction:** Creates a detailed prompt for the LLM (`o3-mini` hardcoded) including:
        *   Document context (type, title, questions).
        *   Target section name and its subtopics.
        *   The full `reference_material`.
        *   The `previously_written_text` from preceding sections.
        *   Instructions on synthesis, citation usage (use provided citations exactly), tone, and output format (start with `## Section Name`).
    *   **LLM Call:** Uses `utils.call_llm` to generate the section text.
    *   **Response Processing:** Handles empty responses. Cleans whitespace. Checks for the expected `## Section Name` header and prepends it if missing or trims preamble if found later.
    *   **Store Result:** Stores the generated text in `written_sections[sec_name]`.
    *   **Update Context:** Appends the newly generated section text to `previously_written_text` for the next iteration.
3.  **Return Value:** Returns the `written_sections` dictionary.

## Observations:

*   **Contextual Generation:** Attempts to maintain narrative flow by including previously written text in subsequent prompts. Effectiveness depends on LLM context handling.
*   **Comprehensive Reference:** Provides the LLM with both high-level summaries and detailed findings with citations.
*   **Citation Reliance:** Depends on the LLM accurately using the pre-formatted citations embedded in the reference material.
*   **Hardcoded Model:** Uses `o3-mini` LLM model.
*   **Complex Prompts:** Generates large and complex prompts for each section.
*   **Sequential Dependency:** Errors or poor quality in one section might negatively impact the context and generation of subsequent sections.
*   **Basic Error Handling:** Handles missing LLM responses and missing headers, but assumes usable text otherwise.
